## Coffee or Patreon?
I created this Ko-fi and Patreon pages because sometimes people asked me in the past on how to be able to donate or help me continue with my work. I wasn't sure if adding these here, but here they are, in case you want to contribute to my caffeine addiction: [BUY ME A KO-FI](https://ko-fi.com/archison) - [PATREON](https://patreon.com/archison) - THANKS A LOT!
